### Two main points

1. Ethics is not about your beliefs, habits, and predilections, but about a **group's consensus on what is the right behavior** of its members that will ensure optimal operation and longevity, whatever the domain or subject matter of interest of the group. 	

2. Ethics can be about everything and anything, but it **requires whole-system analysis** in every case.


#### 	Answer the Questions

#### 1. If all people were ethical in all their interactions, which centerpiece of modern society would be obviated?
	
If all people were ethical in all their interactions, the justice system or judicial system in my opinion would not be necessary and thus removed. Punishments/ consequences in the name of justice would be obviated because there would be no unethical behaviors to review and prosecute.
	
#### 2. Ethics creates a dichotomy between the comfort of the individual and the longevity, or mere existance, of the group. Give an example of an extreme case from recent history that favored the group to the detriment of the individual. How would you embed the principle of balance of the interests of the individual and the group into the ethical code itself? Be specific.

An example that comes to mind is the Gilded Age. In the US, the Gilded Age was a period of transformation that was characterized by economic and industrial growth, increased political participation, immigration, and social reform. This transformation constructed a modern, national industrial society. It changed, the government, technology, economy, and social customs of America. However, the Gilded Age also brought major problems to individuals. Several of problems include, a corrupted government in charge of individuals (big businesses dominated the economy), problems for farmers, and problems for overall workers. For example, industrial workers went through hardships and injustice, as they had to work long hours in dangerous conditions for such a low pay. Not to mention that politicians at this time were corrupt and ineffective. In addition, immigrants faced rough times, as they faced discrimination in their regular lifesyle. Moreover, Native Americans were often forced off their lands and away from their culture.

	
#### 3. **(BONUS)** Ethical codes are vulnerable to the [tragedy of the commons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons). An ethical code relies on the _cooperation_ of the individuals. Discuss how rogue behavior (aka _defection_) with respect to the ethical code of a group gives rise to the [prinsoner's dilemma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner's_dilemma) and the eventual demise of the ethical code. What incentives can you build in the ethical code that would counteract the attractiveness of defection and, as a result, would mitigate the danger to the code?

Rogue behavior with respect to the ethical code of a group, can bring down other members to act in such behavior. It can also cause conflicts between members and upset the group, that eventually leads to all sorts of problems. Another point for example is, if two people where caught breaking the implemented ethical codes it could possibly lead up to examples of the prisoner's dilemma. The two individuals could act in there own self-interest which leads to uncooperation and non-optimal outcomes. A defect if not resolved can cause bigger problems! Eventually, group cooperation and the whole system of ethics implemented in the group will just dissolve, as rogue behavior and self-interests increase. To counteract the attractiveness of defection, an ethical code of consequences/penalties from defective behavior must be implemented. As well as, doing visual behavioral check-ups on employees to catch and stop toxic behavior/actions.


### Class Activities
_Note: Class activities are group but individual submissions are required for grading._
 
#### 1. In a small group up to 5 people, imagine you are a small _tech_ startup. Then:
   #### 1. List the group members below.
   
   - Jesus Castaneda Magallanes
   - Mustafa Azam
   - Jorge Toledano
   - Bao Huynh
   - Logan Pennell
   
   #### 2. Pick a president and write their name below.
   
   - Logan Pennell
   
   #### 3. Describe your technical innovation below.
   - A fully immersed virtual reality system. Shuts down bodily functions and creates a virtual world inside your mind to make the feeling of virtual reality feel more realistic. Accomplished using advanced brain-computer interface technology.
   
#### 2. Describe the ways your innovation, if realized, would affect society. 
   #### 1. Below, list at least 3 adverse effects (including but not limited to _misuse_) of the innovation and anticipatory actions and mechanisms that you can embed: 
   - Lack of real world interaction: Limit the time one can use the VR technology at a time.
   - Harmful to body health: Lock hardware until certain amount of body care is performed. Will require users to meet an exercise quota. Our technology will determine if your body health is decreasing. 
   - Possibly hacking into other's headsets, glitches, etc.: Safeguards will be implemented in the code, and acting VR police will be present in the VR world. Moreover, if somebody tries to hack into something, the device will perform a safe shutdown for user safety.
   - Potential long term effect on brain: Our tech will require the users to take breaks, making sure people spend time in the real world. 
   - Negative psychological effects: Our tech will implement a computer program that serves as a therapist.
   - Surronding enviornment issues (Ex: House on fire): Implement notifications for dangers detected around user's real life environment.
   
   #### 2. Below, give an _explicit_ definition of the fine line between the benefit and detriment of your innovation at two moments of its lifetime: 
#### 	(i) Immediately upon launch: 
 - Having a fully-immersed, alternate, virtual reality will provide endless possibilities and become a hit around the world. Through this invention we will greatly expand the capacity of human consciousness. In consequence, people may become inapt to the real world due to spending too much time on this new technology, and fear may arise of what this advanced tech could do in the hands of the enemies.
 #### 	(ii) After enough time for it to be absorbed into everyday life:
 - A society is built within the software that is then intergrated into our real world society; providing jobs, entertainment, education, and other opportunities to people all around the world. However, our tech could possibly bring down social interaction in real life and possibly de-evolve our real life society, as the VR world blossoms. It will be unsure at this point if this invention will be evolutionary or devolutionary for humans.
   
#### 3. Your small "[band of merry psychopaths](#the-band)" are the pivotal social kernel that can define the proper use of your technology. You have to start early, and hold the line. How are you going to ensure that you stay the course? 
(By implementing and following our code of Ethics.)
   #### 1. Below, define a Code of Ethics (aka Code of Conduct) for your organization that will safeguard your original intentions and values while not stiflying innovation as your startup grows and matures. Your code should have _at most 9 points_.
   1. Changes to this code of ethics require a unanimous vote from all group members. This rule cannot be changed in any way.  
 2. All group members have joint governance over the product and updates to the hardware and software of the product, which will require unanimous votes. 
 3. Private user data must stay confidential, and can not be sold for profit by any team members.
 4. All items/ technology in the company shall be confidential, unless otherwise noted.
 5. A team member must remove themselves from product if there is a conflict of interest. 
 6. Be respectful to other team members and company property. 
 7. Team members are responsible for ensuring the product is as safe as it can be. Failure to ensure product safety will result in evalutation of skills. 
 8. A person breaking any part of the code of conduct, will be subject to evaluation which may result in immediate termination.
 9. Respectively, all around transperancy, honesty, equality, and responsibilty must be distributed to our customers and employees.

#### 4. **(BONUS)** Ethical codes are vulnerable to _hostile takeover_ of the adopting organization. Pick one person from your group and let them _remove 3 points_ from your Code, at their discretion, to be the most damaging overall. 
 Rules removed:
 3. Private user data must stay confidential, and can not be sold for profit by any team members.
 4. All items/ technology in the company shall be confidential, unless otherwise noted.
 8. A person breaking any part of the code of conduct, will be subject to evaluation which may result in immediate termination.
	
   #### 1. Below, discuss how and why the Code has been weakened.
   
Removing three points from our code of ethics has definitely weakened it, and made it more vulnerable. The first point removed was, "Private user data must stay confidential, and can not be sold for profit by any team." So now without this picece in place, private and personal data can be distributed anywhere, with money even allowed as an exchange for data. Second, like the first point, this point also highlights confidentiality, it states: "All items/ technology in the company shall be confidential, (unless otherwise noted)". Without this point, verbal and physical descriptions of our standing technologies at our company will be spread around. Which allows competition and bad people to recreate or alter our technologies. Ultimately, creating devestating and destructive results. With these two points removed, there is absolutely no privacy trust within our business. Lastly, removing the last point, which is: "A person breaking any part of the code of conduct, will be subject to evaluation which may result in immediate termination" is probably the worst. Without this point, nothing stays true and there is no solid foundation for any rules/ethics. Without this point, everyone is allowed to break rules without proper consequences. So, what is there really to stop someone from doing whatever they like without consequences/punishments.
	
   #### 2. Below, discuss how, in retrospect, you should have stated the points of the Code, to make it _robust to disruption_. _Note: Beware of the [paradox of self-amendment](https://legacy.earlham.edu/~peters/writing/psaessay.htm), which, in short, **"...arises when a rule is used as the authority for its own amendment. It is sharper when the rule of change is supreme, sharper still when it is changed into a form that is inconsistent with its original form, and sharpest of all when the change purports to be irrevocable."**_
   	
In our code, we wrote a rule where all changes to the code of conduct must be unanimous and that that rule could not be changed. In addition, we placed a rule where a person breaking any part of the code of ethics will be subject to a consequential evaluation. Rules like this make the code of conduct harder to weaken, because one explains that in order to change/alter the codes of conduct it has to be an unanimous group decision. In addition, the second rule places consequences in place for anyone who does break the code. However, we could have also gave more specific definitions and detailed expectations to make it robust to disruption.


#### The Band
The derogatory expression _band of merry psychopaths_ is used in writing to refer to a small _group of irresponsible or deliberately hostile people with a lot of power_ to affect the world around them.
